argument-clinic
===============

This is a project for UF CIS4301 (Databases).
##Description
Arguing is one of the most popular activities on the interet, and
ArgumentClinic aims to create a social media environment that not only allows,
but encourages argument. When one user posts a controversial statement to
spawn an argument, others may jump in and voice their opinion. Argument
instances are temporary and only remain open for a limited time period, but the
most controversial statements are recycled to generate new arguments based on
the same topic.

##RESOURCES - Ignore this for now, just documenting incomlete setup steps
