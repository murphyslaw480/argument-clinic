Phase 3 --- Between now and April 4th.
Worth 50 points.

As mentioned in class you should be building the backend of your application first.
Phase three will test the development of your database backend. 
For phase three your assignment is to demonstrate and justify the queries that
drive your applications.

Each group will need to select a 10 minuite meeting time with the TAs or graders.
You should do this early as the TA's time is limited.
Each group member should attend this meeting but only one is necessary.

At the TA meeting you will be asked to explain your application's database
and demonstrate the following capabilities:

- [ ] Select (10 pts)

- [ ] Join (10 pts)

- [ ] Aggregate (10 pts)

- [ ] Views (10 pts)

- [ ] Indexes (10 pts)


There are other catefories of queries that TAs will be looking for 
to award extra credit points.
TAs will be grading on working functionality.

As part of your demonstration, you should explain how each of these properties
are used as part of your application. This process should not take longer than
10 minutes.

After your demonstration, the TA will create a team github repository for your
application. You will host the code associated with your website on this github.com
repository.

Within the next 2 days, the TAs will set up times slots for teams to signup. These slots are limited so sign up
early. You should be having regular meetings with each of your group members developing
the application. Do not wait until this deadline to start researching the front end
application!
